//! `waitpid(2)` but for arbitrary non-child processes.
//!
//! [`waitpid(2)`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/wait.html) can only
//! be used to wait for direct child processes, or it fails immediately.
//!
//! This crate provides a extention to wait for the exit of any process, not necessarily child
//! processes. Due to platform limitations, the exit reason and status codes still cannot be
//! retrieved.
//!
//! ## Implementation details
//!
//! - On Linux, [`pidfd_open(2)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pidfd_open.2.html) and
//!   [`poll(2)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/poll.2.html) are used. Thus only Linux 5.3
//!   or later is supported.
//! - On Windows,
//!   [`OpenProcess`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-openprocess)
//!   and
//!   [`WaitForSingleObject`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-waitforsingleobject)
//!   are used.
//! - On *BSD, including macOS,
//!   [`kqueue(2)`](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=kqueue&sektion=2) is used.
//! - Other platforms are not supported currently.

    ///    `open` the PID as soon as possible, before any potential `wait` operations, to mitigate
    ///    the issue.
    /// 2. If the given PID does not exists, it returns `ESRCH` on *NIX immediately. This can
    ///    also happen if the process is exited and reaped before this call. You may want to
    ///    regards this case as a successful wait, but the decision is up to you.
